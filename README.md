# 🩺 MediScan AI – Smart Pneumonia Diagnosis System

MediScan AI is an intelligent web and mobile application designed to assist healthcare professionals in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
It provides **automated diagnosis**, **confidence scoring**, and **visual explanations** through heatmaps, enabling faster and more reliable medical decisions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Diagnosis:** Detects pneumonia from chest X-rays using CNN-based deep learning models (DenseNet121 / ResNet50).
- 💡 **Confidence Score:** Displays the model’s confidence percentage for each prediction.
- 🔥 **Explainability (Grad-CAM):** Generates heatmaps highlighting abnormal lung regions.
- 📊 **Doctor Dashboard:** Provides real-time statistics and analysis summaries.
- 📁 **Patient Record Tracking:** Maintains historical scans for comparison and disease progression monitoring.
- 🧾 **PDF Report Generation:** Automatically generates downloadable reports for each diagnosis.
- 👨‍⚕️ **Admin Panel:** Allows administrators to manage doctors, monitor AI performance, and maintain system updates.

## 🧩 System Architecture

MediScan AI follows a **modular three-tier architecture** for scalability, performance, and security:

### 1️⃣ Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- Built with **React.js / Next.js / Flutter**
- Features responsive UI for web and mobile
- Handles authentication, image upload, and results visualization

### 2️⃣ Application Layer (Backend)
- Powered by **Flask** or **FastAPI (Python)**
- Manages APIs, authentication (JWT), and communication with AI models
- Handles report generation and data exchange

### 3️⃣ AI Engine (Model Server)
- Uses **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for CNN-based pneumonia detection
- Generates predictions, confidence scores, and Grad-CAM visualizations

### 4️⃣ Data Layer
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Storage:** AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage  
- Stores user data, patient history, and AI outputs securely

---

## 🧬 AI Model Workflow

1️⃣ **Image Upload**  
Doctor uploads a chest X-ray image (JPG, PNG, or DICOM).

2️⃣ **Preprocessing**  
Image is resized, normalized, and enhanced for model compatibility.

3️⃣ **Model Inference**  
CNN model (DenseNet121 / EfficientNetB0) predicts *Healthy* or *Pneumonia Detected*.

4️⃣ **Result Generation**  
Outputs include:
- Diagnosis label  
- Confidence score  
- Grad-CAM heatmap  

5️⃣ **Report Creation**  
System generates a structured **PDF report** including:
- Diagnosis result  
- Confidence percentage  
- AI heatmap overlay  
- Doctor’s name and timestamp  

6️⃣ **Data Storage**  
All results are saved in the database for tracking and comparison.
